Azure Functions enable the creation of event driven, compute-on-demand systems that can be triggered by various external events. Learn how to leverage functions to execute server-side logic and build serverless architectures. This learning path can help you prepare for the Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate certification.

## Modules in this learning path

### 1. [Introduction to Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-azure-functions/)

10 min - 5 Units

Learn how Azure Functions helps you to easily integrate serverless compute resources into your cloud-based solutions. An extensive set of bindings makes it easy for you to connect your code to key Azure services, while built-in support for the most used development languages lets you better use your existing skills.

### 2. [Create serverless logic with Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/)

36 min - 6 Units

Azure Functions allows developers to host business logic that can be executed without managing or provisioning infrastructure.

### 3. [Execute an Azure Function with triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/)

1 hr 23 min - 9 Units

A trigger is responsible for executing an Azure function and there are dozens of triggers to choose from. This module will you show you some of the most common types of triggers and how to configure them to execute your logic.

### 4. [Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/)

1 hr 10 min - 8 Units

Azure Functions makes it easy for your function code to integrate with data and services. Through the power of bindings, you declare the data sources to read and write, and let Azure Functions take care of the rest.

### 5. [Create a long-running serverless workflow with Druable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-long-running-serverless-workflow-with-durable-functions/)

46 min - 7 Units

Learn how to orchestrate a long-running workflow as a set of activities using Durable Functions.

### 6. [Develop, test, and deploy an Azure Function with Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-visual-studio/)

43 min - 7 Units

Create test and deploy Azure Functions using Visual studio and how to manage Azure Function code.

### 7. [Monitor GitHub events by usign a webhook with Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-github-events-with-a-function-triggered-by-a-webhook/)

53 min - 10 Units

Webhooks offer a lightweight mechanism for your app to be notified by another service when something of interest happens. In this module. you'll learn how to trigger an Azure function with a GitHub webhook and parse the payload for insights.

### 8. [Enable real-time updates in a web application using Azure Functions and SignalR Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/automatic-update-of-a-webapp-using-azure-functions-and-signalr/) 

55 min - 8 Units

Change a JavaScript web app update mechanism from polling to push-based architecture with SignalR Service, Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Functions.

### 9. [Expose multiple Azure Function apps as a consistent API by using Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-serverless-api-with-functions-api-management/) 

41 min - 6 Units

Combine multiple Azure Functions apps into a unified interface by importing them into a single Azure API Management instance.

### 10. [Build serverless apps with Go](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/serverless-go/)

26 min - 8 Units

When you're authoring Azure functions, custom handlers allow you to use any language or runtime that supports HTTP primitives. In this module, you'll use the programming language Go and custom handlers.
