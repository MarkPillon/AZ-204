Azure lets you create applications composed of various components: web site front-ends, back-end services, and triggered functions that perform compute-on-demand services. Azure also includes various communication strategies to let these various components pass data to each other. Learn how to use these communication services to create scalable, efficient solutions out of testable components

## Modules in this learning path

### 1. [Choose a messaging model in Azure to loosely connect your services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/choose-a-messaging-model-in-azure-to-connect-your-services/)

45 min - 6 Units

When you have an application that consists of components running on different computers, servers, and mobile devices, reliable communications between those components can be difficult and unreliable. Azure provides several technologies that you can use to communicate more reliably, including Storage queues, Event Hubs, Event Grid, and Service Bus. This module shows you how to choose the best technology for your communication task.

### 2. [Implement message-based communication workflows with Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-message-workflows-with-service-bus/)

54 min - 8 Units

Write C# code in a custom application that sends and receives messages using Azure Service Bus topics and queues.

### 3. [Enable reliable messaging for Big Data applications using Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/enable-reliable-messaging-for-big-data-apps-using-event-hubs/)

46 min - 7 Units

Connect sending and receiving applications with Event Hubs so you can handle high loads without losing data.

### 4. [React to state changes in your Azure service by using Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/react-to-state-changes-using-event-grid/)

35 min - 7 Units

Build a serverless application architecture, automate your operations, and integrate applications by handling Azure events with Event Grid.
